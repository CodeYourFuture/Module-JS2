/*
  Count the number of times a word appears in a given string.

  Write a function called countWords that
    - takes a string as an argument
    - returns an object where
          - the keys are the words from the string and
          - the values are the number of times the word appears in the string

  Example
  If we call countWords like this:

  countWords("you and me and you") then the target output is { you: 2, and: 2, me: 1 }

  To complete this exercise you should understand
    - Strings and string manipulation
    - Loops
    - Comparison inside if statements
    - Setting values on an object

## Advanced challenges

1. Remove all of the punctuation (e.g. ".", ",", "!", "?") to tidy up the results

2. Ignore the case of the words to find more unique words. e.g. (A === a, Hello === hello)

3. Order the results to find out which word is the most common in the chapter

function countWords(str) {
  const words = str
    .toLowerCase()
    .replace(/[.,\/#!$%\^&\*;:{}=\-_`~()?]/g, "")
    .split(" "); //removes specific punctuation characters from the string
  const wordCount = {};

  for (const word of words) {
    if (wordCount[word]) {
      wordCount[word]++;
    } else {
      wordCount[word] = 1;
    }
  }

  return wordCount;
}

const result = countWords(
  "Every now and then, usually between 8 p.m. and 10 p.m., Jacques finds himself transforming into a small furry rodent with a bushy tail.On one hand, Jacques is quite glad that he does not have classic lycanthropy. Turning into a squirrel does cause fewer problems than turning into a wolf. Instead of having to worry about accidentally eating the neighbor (that would be awkward), he  worries about being eaten by the neighborâ€™s cat. After two occasions where he woke up on a precariously thin branch in the crown of an oak, naked and disoriented, he has taken to locking the doors and windows of his room at night and putting a few walnuts on the floor to keep himself busy."

console.log(result);
