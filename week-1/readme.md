# ðŸ§­ Guide to Week 1 exercises

This README will guide you through the different sections for this week.

## Setup

Go to the **root of this repository**. Double check you're there with `pwd`. Also double check with `ls`.
**If you're in the root you should be able to see the `week-1`, `week-2` and `week-3` directories**

Run the command `npm install` in the root of this repo.

To run tests in the `week-1` directory you can:

1. Change directory into `week-1`
2. Run the tests using `npm test`
   âœ…

## Fix

In this section, you'll have a function and some tests. The function isn't working for all the tests - you'll need to:

- run the tests
- interpret the test feedback
- fix the tests

To run the tests for the `fix` directory you can `cd` into `week-1` and run `npm test -- fix`.

## ðŸ”¨ Implement

In this section, you will have a short set of requirements about a function. You will need to implement a function based off this set of requirements. Make sure you check your function works for a number of different inputs.

Here is a recommended order:

1. `max.test.js`
2. `sum.test.js`
3. `dedupe.test.js`

## ðŸ§¹ Refactor

In these problems, you'll be given an implementation and then asked to change it. Once you've updated the implementations you'll need to double check that they are still working!

Once you've completed all these tasks, raise a PR with your work so far. Don't wait to complete your coursework before completing the PR.
